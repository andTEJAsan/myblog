## Status Quo
- Over the past one and a half month, I have been living in kyoto as a research intern
at Kyoto University. I was among the lucky 18 students selected from the IITs for the
KU-STAR (Kyoto University Short Term Academic Research Program). 

- I have been working with Professor Kohei Suenaga in Professor Atsushi Igarashi's Lab in the Graduate School of Informatics.
