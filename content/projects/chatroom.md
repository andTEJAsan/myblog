This project is a simple chat room application implemented using the `boost::asio` library in C++. The chat room allows multiple clients to connect to a server and exchange messages in real-time. The server acts as a central hub, relaying messages between clients.

You can also whisper to specific clients by mentioning their username in the message. The server will ensure that the message is delivered only to the intended recipient.
